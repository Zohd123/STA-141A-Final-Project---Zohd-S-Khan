# STA-141A-Final-Project---Zohd-S-Khan
This document includes a report and a support R markdown file to the report. The report covers 
a project in which a prediction model is formed to predict the decisions of mice based on data on 
their neural activity recorded in an experiment covered in 2019.  Comments are included on all code chunks 
explaining the code, and the report is generated in html format. 

Following are the ordered code chunks in the RMD file:
1.    **Loading Test Sets for Prediction Model**
2.     2 Test Files (Note: must the correct path all the way to file name except index number an extension.
3.    **Loading Data across 18 relevant sessions** Note: must the correct path all the way to file name except index number an extension.
4.    1 - 18 Sessions in the chunk 
5.    **Exploring neural activities across trials in all sessions**
6.    ** Explore changes across trials**
7.    **Exploring homogeneity and heterogeneity across sessions and mice**
8.    **Extracting shared patterns across sessions**
9.    **Addressing the differences between sessions**
10.    **Enhancing the prediction performance**
11.    **Predictive Modeling**
12.    **Predictive performance on the test sets**
13.    **Appendix**

The session data was used to train and test the moel in "11. **Predictive Modeling**"  and susquently in "12.    **Predictive performance on the test sets**" moel was tested with actual data. The performnace with test data was much more consistent as compared to with session data testing.

 

Also added an appendix with some potentially useful codes that we decided to leave out of final report.
